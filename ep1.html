The loud click of the spotlight startled Kyle a little. He felt the warm light embrace his skin. More intense, however, were the eyes of the anxious on-lookers awaiting his next move. The clock slowly counted down.

 3…… 

“Make it pop”, he told himself.

2……

He gripped his halo reactor mod with the customized prime-op coils. 

“There are many like it, but this one is mine.” He recited to himself.

He was King Arthur and his vape was Excalibur. Today was the day he would claim his throne, today was the day he would change his destiny.

1……

He placed his weapon upon his lips and began to pull his ammunition into his lungs. He felt the warm presence of his Shirley Temple flavored e-juice and began to step into his routine.

Errrrrrrr. The buzzer went off.  He stepped out onto the linoleum floor of the West Lincoln Middle School Gymnasium to the symphonic beats of “I’m a Stoner” by Young Thug and Wiz Khalifa. The tape he made was expertly mixed and his moves were perfectly choreographed.

He started with a double set of 8 mini dragon rings. The small donut sized clouds shot out of his mouth with precision. He tilted his head down taking another long pull on his vape. 

His disproportionately large rib cage had finally come in handy.

 He exhaled one more time, producing a much larger ring. He brought his lips to his weapon and pulled off, splitting his once larger creation into two smaller ones. The smoke rings danced into the crowd. The melodic muttering of Thug and Wiz dubbed over a Crazy Frog drum beats carried the clouds to the heavens. 

Now it was time for his finale. He pulled a lung-full of smoke, maybe his biggest pull ever, and placed his finger to his cheek and exhaled. He sent several smaller rings out of the sides of his mouth. With one last exhale, he slid across the gym floor to the feet of the judges, expunging a single cloud of smoke from his nostril. The smoke moved ever so gently. It finally caught flight into a beautiful ring of smoke. The last ring-ding-dong of the Crazy Frog monologue signaled the end of his set and the nasal creation dissipated over the judge’s heads. 

Kyle did not pause a second for the judges reactions. Does Matt Damon turn back as he walks away from an explosion in one of his movies? Ney. Kyle did not turn back to see the explosion he had just created in the judge’s heads. An o-ring out of the nose had never been done before. He knew he had won. The Southeastern Michigan Tri-County Vape Trophy was his. He stood on top of the pedestal as a King stands atop his castle. He knew he was on his way to bigger and better things. This was just the start. 

What he didn’t know was that he was being watched. In the back of the littered bleachers sat a tall man in a white thobe and a checkered-red ghutra. His tight black eyes sat behind a pair of tinted circular sunglasses. What the judges saw in Kyle Debilny was just a talented young kid. What this man saw was potentional.
 


For the first time, Kyle walked home a champion. The trophy was plastic but it weighed heavy in his heart. He was tired of losing. He was a winner and everyone would feel the pain that they once inflicted on him. He had to hurry to get home and hide this trophy before his mother got home from work. She loved him, but did not approve of his vaping. She didn’t understand how he feels when he wins, how he feels when he practices his routines and finally hits the big trick.

 He was jogging around the block when he spotted Jimmy Westmoreland and his cronies. Westmoreland was the kicker on the football team, 4.0 grade average and headed to Stanford next fall. He was basically a giant douche-bag. Westmoreland and his gang of testosterone-loaded assholes constantly gave Kyle shit, especially when it came to vaping. They were sitting around Joe’s Corner Store, all with lips full of chewing tobacco trying to look cool. Kyle tried to zip by them, but Westmoreland quickly stuck his foot out and tripped him. Kyle fell to the ground and his trophy skidded to the feet of some ape in a letterman jacket.

“Nice trophy Debliny.” Jimmy said as his friend tossed him the trophy.

“Southeastern Michigan Tri-Country Vape Champion, wow, so that makes you the coolest kid at the retard table.” Jimmy said.

“Hey give that back”

“Ok, here you go.” Jimmy took the trophy and broke it on his leg. He threw the broken trophy at Kyle’s feet.

“Now get the fuck out of here you smokey fag.” He said as he shot out some brown tobacco spit.

“Yeah fucking bird-boy,” Another taunted.

“Bird boy! Bird Boy! Bird Boy!” They mocked his disproportionate torso in unison now. Bird boy was an old favorite, but it still hurt. 

Kyle ran away even faster. He hated those assholes so much. He worked so hard for that trophy and now he had nothing to show for it. There was no longer any reason to go home. He decided to go to Vick’s Vapor Store because it was the only place he felt safe and the nicotine helped soothe his stress.



He walked into the Vick’s. The freshly ripped smoke invited his body inside. Darren, Vick’s ex-wife’s husband, was working the counter. He was visibly nervous; none of the usual guys had populated the store yet, so something was definitely weird.

“Hey big man, there’s a visitor for you.” Darren said pointing to the lounge chairs.

The mountain berry vape smoke cleared in the corner of the room revealing two men in long robes. One man’s white, the others a navy blue, but both were wearing sandals. Kyle had never seen anyone dress like this before; both of their beards were very long. One wore small-circle shaped sunglasses that made him look like a hippie. The hippie-looking guy raised a single finger in the air while taking a long pull from his vape. 

“Please Mr. Kyle, sit,” The man with the vape said.

 “We’ve been waiting a long time for you,” He laughed.

As Kyle got closer, he saw the vape the man was using. It had a shiny golden mod with brass knuckles on the side, along with a black box with white squiggly lines engraved on the other side.

“Wow, sweet mod mister,” Kyle said looking down at the one man’s hand.

“Yes, it was a gift,” He replied.

“My people have been watching you very careful, Kyle. Your skills…… are very enticing to what my people do.” He was a man who meant what he said when he talked, even though it was obvious that English was not his first language. 

“Thanks man that means a lot. All I try to do is make it pop.” Kyle giggled looking at the other man and back to the man with the glasses. Neither cracked a smile.

“Kyle, you very much make it pop, you pop it as if it is also very hot.” His intense eye glowed through the blue tit of his glasses. Kyle could feel the black fire that seeped through them. Kyle could not tell if he was a good or bad man, but whatever he wanted, he wanted very bad.

“Sunshine vacation starts in a week, yes?” the man asked.

“Yes, summer vacation, if that’s what you mean”

“Ah yes, precisely. 

“Listen Kyle,” the man suddenly grew a sterner tone. 

“You are champion, but where is trophy?”

“Some asshole kids broke it,” Kyle replied, suddenly aware of the dried tears on his face.

“This is reason for point,” The man stammered. 

“You are vapestar. What my seeing eyes have seen is some of the most purest vape talent in world, yet you are ridiculed. What respect does vape get? It is healthy, yes? It is fun, yes?”

Kyle nodded.

“But no, everyone see vapists as stupid-dumb people. I am from an organization who feels a similar pain.” The man’s eyes began to flare with fury.

“We see the truth in the light. We have listened to the lord; we know the path to his salvation. Yet we have no power, our people are forced to live in squalor with no hope.” The man continued.

“We will strike the non-believer with a force of a thousand tidal waves!”

“We will punish the infidels with terror unaimagin….” In his fury, he realized he had gone too far and settled down.

“We need people like you, the vapists. The shunned from society to help show people the one true light.”

Kyle saw that the man’s heart was beating and he was struggling to contain his anger.

“What I mean to talk is this; we are forming a vaping team, made up of your country’s best vapists. We will show that we are powerful and demand respect. We want you to join.”

Kyle stammered, but before he was able to respond the man held out small piece of paper.

“Here is my card. Next week I will send a plane to pick you up and start journey.”
The man handed him a card that was covered in squiggly symbols he didn’t recognize. He could make out some English that read,

‘Abdus Salam Nazari’

 He and his partner got up and disappeared into the smoke.
