2:30 Monday afternoon. 

Richard Dexter hid behind the corner of the hallway. 

*Click*Click*Click*

The shiny black stilettos delivered the sound of intent, of an independent woman who had somewhere to go. Richard knew exactly who this woman was and exactly where she was going. Her name was Ms. Kirschbaum and she was going to the bathroom.

He gazed at her stride, one long tan leg after another stepping seductively, creating a tight twist in her grey skirt. Behind her glasses she gazed with piercing blue eyes, her nose sharp and defined with purpose on her face. She had been sculpted to be God’s great seducer.

Richard was in her English class his freshman year. His brain had no room for Steinbeck or Homer, only of the possibilities of a future with Mrs. Krischbaum.

That was freshman year and Richard is now a sophomore. He is now a man of action. And now is the time to act. He had been so frustrated trying to seduce Ms. Kirschbaum. He had been unable to talk to her about anything, school-work, whatever. Still, he couldn’t stop thinking about her; she was so out of his league. Like so far out. This is when his he thought of his plan, it was very simple. Ms. Kirschbaum was set to use the bathroom every day after 7th period. All he had to do was sit quietly in the adjacent stall and he could share an intimate moment when she was slightly undressed. It was simple, yet so erotic and perverted.  He felt silly thinking up this plan, but he had to do something.

He peeked one more time to make sure she had turned into the restroom when he felt a finger tap him on the shoulder. It was Coach Kolchuk.

“Hey bud whatcha staring at?” He asked with a look of suspicion. 

The bastard must’ve snuck down the staircase in the back, he thought briefly. But Richard had little time to think, he hadn’t responded in a few seconds. He stammered.

“I was looking for my girlfriend….” He spurted. He was so stupid; he had no girlfriend.

“Aw ok” Coach Kolchuk said with a very slow downward movement of his head, as if he hadn’t believed what he said. 

“I was just making sure you weren’t spying on any of those freshman girls, Richy boy.” He said as he slapped him on the back.

Richard sarcastically laughed and Coach Kolchuk walked away. As he waddled down the hallway, Richard realized how fat Kolchuk really was. He had also realized that Coach had farted during their brief conversation; he could taste it in his mouth. God, he was gross. Richard had only spent one semester his freshman year with Kolchuk and he proved to be a world-class creep.

He spent all night sitting in his bed thinking about Ms. Kirschbaum. He then wondered if Kolchuk was on to his plan. He couldn’t care, it can’t bother him. Richard was obsessed with Ms. Kirschbaum, his plan had to go into effect tomorrow. What was Kolchuk going to do? Make him run a lap? He was able to calm himself down. He knew for a fact that Ms. Kirschbaum was a creature of habit. He marked his calendar for tomorrow. That was the day he would get what he wanted.

The next day Richard could hardly wait for his moment. It would be glorious. Everything he had wished for would come true. He couldn’t think about anything else. He had a physics test third period and he didn’t even answer the last three questions. He asked if he could use the bathroom with 10 minutes left in the day and he took his backpack and left. He headed straight for the teacher’s bathroom. He walked rapidly through the halls to deter any attention from any inquisitive staff. He walked perpendicular on the hall where the teacher’s bathroom was located, then checked the opposite hallway along with the staircase adjacent to that. Once he felt that all angles were checked he rushed to the restroom to avoid any last minute sightings. He paced past the classrooms making sure to not make any eye contact with the students. He made one last turn back into the hallway of the teacher’s restroom taking just a second glance at Ms. Kirschbaum’s room. He was now ready for her.

He skipped through the hall attempting to make the least amount of steps as possible. He opened the door to the teacher’s restroom very quickly, jumping behind the door and pulling it back faster, but slowly turning the handle into place so that it made no noise. 

He heard the bell ring.

“Shit!” He cursed and quickly stepped into the handicapped stall. He picked that one because it was farther from the wall. He closed the stall door then sat on the toilet seat with his arms wrapped on his legs so no one would be able to see his feet. 

He sat through the sounds of the swarmed halls until the voices dissipated, deep in the distance the clicks of stiletto heels signaled her approach. His body tensed with excitement. He would be so close. He was very nervous. The clicks got louder and the door swung open. 

Her strides were quick and short, almost too often, like a running pace. She ran up to the door of his stall and yanked hard. He was such an idiot. He picked the wrong stall! He was so fucked. After a couple of hard pulls, Ms. Kirschbuam surrendered into the smaller stall. The brutal sound of the toilet seat hitting the bowl was not consistent with the usual grace of Ms. Kirschbaum, something was up. He saw her perfectly tanned feet and heels sitting apart on the bathroom stall. She pulled down her purple lace panties to her ankles. He almost fainted. Sitting there on the toilet, Richard was in ecstasy. Just knowing Ms. Kirschbaum was exposed sitting right next to him, it was so intimate. The moment was past erotic, it was a spiritual experience.  Richard embraced the plastic barrier with the side of his face trying to get as close as possible to her. It felt warmer than ever. He felt at one with her in that small restroom. 

These moments of ecstasy only lasted a brief second. The melodic gorgeousness of the moment was punctured by the symbolic breaking of a violin string. Out protruded one of the longest and nastiest farts Richard had ever smelled. Its vileness immediately expanded into every corner of the room. It was a fart that did not have a dramatic noise, but rather a long drawn out puff. Almost like her asshole was taking a nice long yawn. Richard plugged his nose in an attempt to defend from the putrid smell. What followed the gas was a series of rectal cannonball fire. One after another,

“Boom!” He could hear the excrement run out, followed by an adjacent splash of the toilet water. 

This pattern followed a series of three expulsions, topped off by a nice wet squirty fart. Richard covered his mouth and avoided inhalation for almost 45 seconds. He was sitting on the toilet smashing his head into his arms hoping to end the torture.

He then heard the rumblings of the toilet paper dispenser as Ms. Kirschbaum attempted to stomp out the fire that was her anus. She slowly pulled her panties up and then continued the natural smooth stride of her heels. 

Click * Click * Click.

Richard heard the swing of the bathroom door and ran out when Ms. Kirschbaum had walked away. His face beat red from holding his breath and also from holding back his vomit. He ran out in tears, headed for the nearest trash can. Out poured the mozzarella sticks he had for lunch, along with his pure, boy-like innocence. He turned to watch Ms. Kirschman slowly walk away. Still, her perfect figure caught his eye as strings of viscous spittle hung out of his mouth. He felt an old pudgy hand on his shoulder, it was Coach Kolchuk. He continued to vomit.

“There isn’t a woman out there like her.”

“I used to say I’d suck the fart out of her ass until I found out she did that every day after school,” Coach chuckled. 

Ms. Kirschbaum stopped mid stride to see Richard puking out his lunch. She shot a finger pistol in his direction and said,

“Next time stay out of the handicap stall, that’s my favorite” And continued to walk away.

Richard and Kolchuk stood both speechless. They were dumbfounded with a mix of different reactions, but what stood out was an unprecedented state of arousal.
