“I apologize, Mr. Kyle. It is of much importance that we keep your faces covered. Do not be alarmed.” Abdus assured.

Kyle barely cracked open one of his eyes. The sunlight burned his retinas. He could feel the deep impression of its rays in his skin. His body was so sore. He realized that he was sandwiched between Torque and Keith. He could tell by Keith’s cargo shorts and assumed the black legs belonged to Torque. 

“Where are we?” Kyle asked. His mouth was so dry.

“Welcome to Syria!” Abdus cried from the passenger seat. 
Kyle observed the arid landscape and saw a man in tattered clothing lead a camel across the road. Kyle had been to Sears many times and it never looked anything like this.

The road was long and extremely bumpy. A few minutes later, Torque woke up with a similar experience of confusion. Keith continued to sleep. The driver pulled into a small village. Two young men, probably younger than Kyle, were standing guard at the entrance of large wooden door. 

“Put on hoods again,” Abdus said.

Kyle could hear some small banter and the sound of an opening gate. He heard the engine start up and the car slowly creep across the sand. As the driver continued, he heard the sound of normal human life, children playing, women talking and men arguing. The vehicle drove for a few minutes and into a building. Kyle could feel the shade of a structure engulf the vehicle. He heard the car doors being opened and a man instructed everyone to get out of the car. He could feel Torque in front of him. Abdus instructed them to move in line, but very quietly. Kyle could hear another door open. They were led inside another room and then Abdus announced.

“Kneel before the Caliph, the almighty on earth and this country!” 

Kyle felt a hand on his shoulder so he slightly bent down to his knees. Suddenly, his hood was lifted off. He saw a huge white room, with beautifully designed ceilings and very clean linoleum floors. A large man with a large grey beard stood before him in a golden throne. He was wearing a long black dress looking thing. To his sides stood three young men, they couldn’t have been over fifteen. The man in the throne began to spurt out what seemed to be random noise. It wasn’t until Abdus translated, that Kyle realized the man was speaking another language and it was directed at him. 

“The Caliph wants to thank you for coming to his country. He understands that your journey was wide, but he hopes Abdus was good company.” Abdus translated.

The sitting man spurted out again, this time with more intensity.

“We sit here today on the brink of a new world, a world whose guide is the great prophet Mohammed. We are his children.” Abdus stated.

“Us have been keep down by the powers of the West and our ideology squashed. But in humble time the fire in hearts grown strong. The shunning of world, has burned deep into us. We are new army. We ask of you’se to be soldiers in Americas for us, to bring light unto those wrong-doers. Our ideas are big because of hated. Out of hatred, we grown. We grown strong in darkness. What West believes is darkness, we know as true light of Lord. We must punish those who have punish us. With acceptance of these gift you accept message and accept duties as one of our loyalist soldiers.” Abdus continued as a translator.

Abdus made another clap with his hands and a little boy ran out holding a silk black pillow. On top of the pillow sat three golden vapes, just like the one Abdus had at the vapeshop.

“Cooooool,” Keith said as he grabbed for his vape. 

The little boy moved towards Kyle offering one of the vapes. Kyle wasn’t sure of anything that Abdus had just said, but he did feel that by taking this vape it was some kind of commitment. He looked at Torque who was heavily fixated on the vape. Then at Abdus, who was staring at Kyle anxiously, then the man in the chair who had a deeply concerned look. He decided that pissing the wrong person off would not be a good idea. So he grabbed one. He was actually very impressed and had been thinking about this mod as soon as he saw Abdus with it at Vick’s Vape Shop. It was definitely a good get. Kyle grabbed his and the little boy ran off. The man began to speak again.

“Very well, go out into world and spread word of our people.” Abdus translated.

 With vapes in hand, everyone stood up and was marched out of the room. They were led into what looked like a garage and they were piled back into the car. The slowly pulled out and were drove the way they came back. Torque and Keith were fixated on their vapes and awed the whole drive, but Kyle couldn’t help from looking at the surrounding village. Children stood silent, men who were in the market had paused to watch them drive by. Up on the road, a small child tried to run across, but tripped. The driver slammed on his brakes and started yelling the child. Two men with guns hastily grabbed the child and pulled him to the side. The car sped off but the men pulled the child to the side of the road and were brutally beating him with the butts of their rifles. At this point, Keith and Torque had been watching. Abdus was watching briefly until he realized that the three in the back were watching this act of brutality.

“HOODS ON! HOODS ON!” He screamed. 

They did what he said and returned their eyes to darkness. 

Kyle was happy he had slept on the trip down because the ride back was so long. They drove for hours onto a bumpy road. Only one time did they stop and were allowed to take off their hoods to drink water and eat some bread. The journey was long and included another plane ride, this time, with mask on the whole trip.

“Ok, hoods off now.” Abdus said.

Kyle looked around, they were in front of Dubai international airport. 

“Ok, everyone. I hope you enjoy your time. We are counting on you to put your talent to the quiz and help our people. We have boughten you each plane tickets to your respectable homes. Also, it is against the rule to bring vaporizer onto plane. We bought you each specialized bag that keeps vape hidden from metal-tector.” He held up a book bad and pointed to a specific pocket in which to hold the vape. 

“I hope you good time on journey and will speak to you soon. Please keep our people in your hearts.” He added.

The driver got out and opened the door for the three to get out. He popped the trunk and handed everyone their luggage and special carry-on bag. The three waved good bye to Abdus and walked into the airport.

They eventually got to the checkpoint where they had to split up. Kyle shook hands Keith and Torque and followed each other on instagram. They both walked away. Kyle took a second to text his parents who probably were worried about him.

 As he was sitting down he saw a small child run away from his mother and trip right in front a security guard. The security guard was surprised and almost stepped on the kid. The child burst out into screaming tears that reminded him off the kid in the village. The security guard grabbed the child up and pretended that he had grabbed the child’s nose. The child immediately stopped crying and started to giggle. Then the security guard grabbed the child by his hand and helped find his mother. This was the complete opposite of what he had seen in the village. The child’s screaming in the village still rang in his head. He thought of the driver yelling at the kid and then the two armed men, who did not hesitate to brutally punish a child.

 He began to think about the nature of those people and what he had committed to. The man in seat and Abdus always talked about how they are oppressed by the people in power and it is their goal to bring them pain. He began to think about vaping in general and the only reason he practiced so much was to irritate his parents. He didn’t actually like it. Plus, nicotine is a harmful and addictive chemical. His parents probably just wanted the best for him. He texted his dad, 

“I’m sorry.  I will be home soon.”

He then looked at the vape that the man in the chair had given him. God, it was so nice. All that talk about being a soldier, the commitment scared him. He wasn’t ready to commit his life to anything, let alone some men he just met. He wasn’t ready to commit to vaping either. 

He made one long sigh, throwing out the vape in the trash and returning home. 

A few hours later the new read,

THREE TERROR ATTACKS STRIKE THIS AFTERNOON.

“Three terror attacks strike the nation today. All three were automatic bombs that detonated simultaneously. Two of the bombs were on planes heading to the United States, another in the Dubai Airport. We are unable to estimate total casualties at the moment, but ISIS has already publicly claimed responsibility for these attacks.”
