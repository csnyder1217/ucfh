It was a foggy summer morning when Kyle and Darren pulled up to the Southeastern Michigan Regional Airport.

They pulled through the empty tarmac to find a single white private jet with the air stairs pulled out. A man Kyle recognized as Abdus stood at the bottom of the stairs.

Kyle jumped out of the car absolutely amazed by the plane. He had never been inside of one before. He waved Darren goodbye.

“Wow, you weren’t kidding when you said we are flying. Are you guys oil tycoons or something?” Kyle asked as he was led up the stairs. 

“You can say that,” Abdus remarked. 

Kyle walked onto the plane and was absolutely amazed. It was fully-equipped with huge leather seats, a shag carpet, an aquarium and three different T.V’s. Two other kids were playing Grand Theft Auto II on one of the T.V.’s. 

“Hello fellas, I would like you to meet freshest addition to team, Kyle Debliny,” Abdus said while applauding.

“Kyle this is Torque.” He pointed to a lanky black kid sitting in a leather recliner. 

“That must be Torque Washington,” He thought to himself. Kyle had followed him on instagram three years prior and was a huge fan of his work. So he told him.

“I’m a huge fan, that double reverse dragon trick is the shit.” Kyle exclaimed with an extended hand ready to shake.

“Thanks bro.” Torque said without moving his eyes from the game. Torque was an inner-city kid who grew up in Patterson, New Jersey. He was infamous for his delinquency, spending time in juvenile detention centers and eventually prisons. He found vaping, and the fame that came with it, to be his only way to make a name for himself. 

“And this, is Keith Levinson” Abdus said

“Hey,” Kyle said rhetorically, attempting to recoup the embarrassment from his last introduction. Kyle knew everything about Keith too. His dad was the head of some bottle water company and he always had the filthiest mods. Kyle watched him power through the competition at the Northeast regional.

“We have long journey to Dubai, so I want you fellas to relax.” Abdus added. 

“If you need anything else attention me,” Abdus said walking away.

Kyle watched Torque and Keith play Grand Theft Auto and vape for almost six hours. He attempted to play one round, but died miserably. The two other kids seemed to be so nonchalant about the absolute violence they inflicted. Torque would often make a comment about how he would see the same things in the hood. Kyle knew he was lying. Keith tried to agree with Torque but the only hood he had ever been in had a Fox Racing logo on its side. Keith would comment about how he would wreck expensive cars in real life and how his parents didn’t care. Kyle felt out of his league. He felt honored to be surrounded with such talented kids like these. Kyle played around with his mod for a few hours and worked on a few tricks until he eventually drifted off to sleep.

“Rise up, rise up, rise up,” Abdus was screaming while slowly shifting his weight from one foot to another, creating the movement of a paraplegic horse. When Kyle first met Abdus he was very afraid, but he seemed a lot goofier than he let on. 

“Grab things, grab things. We need to make move around.” Abdus chanted until everyone was able to start getting up. The airplane door opened into a dark, asphalt desert. Wherever they were it had to be late. 

“Welcome, to Dubai” Abdus said.

The three young men were shuffled into a limo, fully equipped with drinks and snacks. The limo pulled through downtown and Kyle gazed at the towering buildings. The limo pulled into the foyer of what looked to be a large hotel. Men were guarding the shiny golden doors and stood ready for party. Abdus opened the limo door and the boys piled out.

“Are you ready to get on your party?” Abdus yelled.

“Woop, woop” 

 He trotted across the velvet carpet into the door way. Throwing his hands in the air and successively howling. This was a regular hotel with a regular lobby.  Guests from all different cultures seemed to be swarming in and out, minding their own business. Abdus continued to prance around the hotel like no one was watching. As they began to walk farther, Kyle could feel the deep, throbbing beats that were bumping throughout the walls and floors. The noise was coming from what looked like a conference room with a purple under-glow seeping out from under the door cracks. Abdus pulled the door open.

The space looked to be a hotel conference room complete with bland, beige walls and old red carpet. However, loud music and lights shot across the room to the beat of a computerized drum.
The plain red carpet was scatted with round sofa-looking things. Hundreds of people were sitting low to the ground. Women wore headdresses yet exposed their mid-drift, carried trays of grilled meat. The loud deafening beat seemed like a combination of modern electric music and a traditional Middle-Eastern sound. Abdus led the group through the party. He stopped next to a sofa-looking thing and instructed the group to sit. Already seated, was a very fat man with a headpiece and a large mustache. He was sitting next to a nearly naked woman who had a beaded headdress that covered a majority of her face. She was feeding him grapes as the man puffed on a hookah. Abdus clapped his hands twice very deliberately and a line of women walked out with trays of meat. They handed everyone chalices and passed around large platters of shish-kabobs. Kyle was starving and immediately tore at the grilled meat. With a mouth full of food, he took a large gulp from his drink only to realize the chalice was filled with wine. Kyle had never had alcohol before and didn’t enjoy his first experience. He attempted to flag down a waitress.

“Do you have pepsi?” Kyle inquired.

The fat man with the mustache burst out into laughter and like a chimney, smoked fumed out. The waitress, confused, shuffled away.

“For you, for you,” The fat man pleaded as he handed Kyle a hookah.

Kyle had no idea what a hookah was. He took the pipe out of the man’s hand, assuming it was just like his vape, and took a very long pull. There was a lot of smoke and the inhale burned his lungs. Kyle expunged the smoke and coughed violently.  This amused the fat man even more and he attempted to help Kyle by pouring wine into Kyle’s mouth. Kyle hated the taste of wine but allowed the cool liquid to sooth his lungs. The next thing he knew, he had drank the whole glass. He began to feel more relaxed. He stared at the fat man and giggled.

“He’s so funny,” Kyle thought, while gazing at his plump body.

“He’s such a nice guy,”

“Is this what being drunk feels like?” Kyle wondered to himself.

“Hey, Hey,” Kyle shouted and lightly tapped the fat man’s belly until he gave him his desired attention.

Kyle made a small pull from the hookah and puffed a tiny little smoke ring out of his nostril, his signature trick. The fat man was absolutely entranced as he watched the smoke float into the air. Kyle then ripped an enormous burp through the smoke. The burp and smoke combination blew a serious gust of wind into the man’s face. He could see the hairs on his mustache brace the winds like a palm tree during a hurricane. The man paused, without moving an inch, eyes closed. Kyle’s body tensed up. He felt as if he had offended the man. He looked over to Torque and Keith who were sat dead silent, waiting for the some kind of reaction. Quickly, the fat man opened his eyes and retaliated with another, fiercer burp right back into Kyle’s face.

“Ha, ha!” He pointed and laughed. 

Kyle was taken aback; he had to roll over in an attempt to dodge the rancid fumes. Everyone was howling laughing. The man grabbed Kyle by his hand and stood him up. He handed him another chalice of wine and shouted:

“HERE ARE A CHAMPION,” With his chalice in the air, he clinked it against Kyle’s and they both chugged their drinks as the rest of the room shouted.

“CHAMPION!” In a drunken, unordered stupor.

When Kyle sat down his body felt warm and his head felt light. He took another rip of the hookah and the fat man talked with Keith and Torque. He had never felt like this before. The moments began to blend together. The electronic beat of the DJ sunk into his body. He danced intimately with the fat man and the woman. Belly dancers were brought out. Kyle and the fat man launched grapes at them until they both jumped onto stage and slapped each other’s bellies. That was the last thing he remembered.

The next thing he felt was the hot sun breaking into the black cloth that covered his face. A hard bump slammed his face into another person’s shoulder. Kyle began to freak out. 

“Am I dead?” He asked.

“What happened last night? Is my heart beating?” When he tried to move his hand he realized that he was zip tied. Someone must’ve noticed he was awake and pulled off the hood covering his face. It was Abdus. 

“Good sunshine, Mr. Kyle.”
