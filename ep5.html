The early morning sun shined through the settling smoke. The neighborhood that once greeted the day with singing birds and meandering school children was now met by the charred remnants of a former home. Police and firemen scoured through the remains. The coroner and a young detective talked next to a fire truck,

“Any bodies?” The detective asked.

“None from the fire. We only found one guy shot in the head,” the coroner said.

“He was the only one in the house?” The detective asked.

“The fire department rescued his wife. Another neighbor ran in to help her and got burned up real bad. He’s down at County General,” The coroner walked over to the truck. 

“Damn,” The young detective said after taking a long pull from his cigarette. 

All that was going through the young detective’s mind was how badly this fiasco would affect the value of the neighborhood.

As he snubbed out his cigarette, the detective thought how negatively this would impact the neighborhood’s value.


Agent Chris Henry pulled into the Sante Fe police department around 8 a.m. His car reeked of cigarettes and old coffee, but he was in a good mood.

He walked into the station, directly to the homicide unit. Two young detectives were going over files in their office,.

“You’re early,” one detective said.

“The commute was easier than your mother, Sanchez,” Henry responded, throwing his coat down and closing the door.

“Can you remind us why we have the pleasure of dealing with your smart ass again,” Sanchez retorted.

“Well, to make a long story short, the victim is related to some cartel boss in Mexico. The boys in Washington were thinking this was the product of some turf war between him and some El Cucuy character.

“Oh shit, El Cucuy? I’ve heard about this guy. I heard he murdered some supplier’s cousin on vacation just because he raised the price on his coke leaves,”

“Yeah, I heard he killed someone’s wife for crossing his path in the street,” The other detective said. 

“Well, the brass is thinking the same thing has happened down here and they have sent their best foot soldier to come down and sniff the shit,” Henry said pouring himself some coffee.
“Oh, you’re gonna smell shit alright, but it’s only from the breath of that dirty hooker you had breakfast with this morning,” Sanchez said leaning back in his chair.

“Let’s get some things straight Sanchez, I would never buy her breakfast and you shouldn’t talk about your sister like that,” The other detective spit his coffee back into his cup.

Henry sternly gazed at the woman sitting in the interrogation room, “Did she say anything about his family?”

“Nope not a thing, we didn’t even know all of this until now. She is convinced that it was their mailman, Gary LeFraine, but she thinks he was going by some alias the whole time. Authorities in Las Vegas have already detained a man by the same name, says he was in Vegas for the weekend and has no idea about the murders,” Sanchez said tossing Henry a folder.

Henry briefly sifted through the set of papers.

“Let me get a few minutes with her,”

“Do your worst princess,”

Vizual Riveras was a middle-aged Latin woman with voluminous graying hair and large framed glasses. She had deep set wrinkles on the sides of her eyes and around her mouth. Her eyes were glassy and distant. She sat in a chair with a small cup of coffee in front of her.

Henry opened the door abruptly with files in his under his arms.

“Hello Mrs. Riveras. How are we today?” He said pulling out the chair.

“I’ve been better,” Her English was perfect.

“I am Agent Henry from the D.E.A., I just wanted a few moments with you if that’s alright,” Henry said as he sat in the chair.

“Honestly Mr. Henry, that is not alright. I have told them everything I know. I did not kill my husband and I need to get out of this place,”

“All in due time Vizual. Is it o.k. if I call you Vizual?” Henry said as he got organized.

Vizual shrugged in indifference, taking another sip of coffee.

“I believe you didn’t kill your husband, but I need to hear your story again. Where were you last night?”

“Last night, like I told the other assholes, I was watching TV in my room. My husband was in his office going over papers. It was a usual Friday night for us.”

“What were you watching?”  Henry asked.

“Investigation Discovery, it was the season premiere of Homicide Hunter,” She said.

Henry made a smirk,

“With Joe Kenda? I love that show. My girlfriend calls me crazy because it is what I do for a living, but what can I say? I love a good murder mystery. 

“Yes, it is my favorite show as well. I was watching around midnight when I heard a loud boom, like a door being broken into. I remember hearing Carlos’ voice and then a gunshot. At this point, I had run and hid in the bathroom. It was several minutes until I realized our house was on fire and I ran out with as many belongings as I could,”

“So walk me through your suspicion of the mailman,” Henry asked.

 “Our old mail man, Mike, introduced us to all of the neighbors when we first moved into the area. He was just the sweetest and most caring man. It was about a year and a half ago when he retired. That is when we first met Gary. He was apparently Mike’s best friend at the post office and Mike assured us we would love Gary just as much as we loved him.

We trusted Mike and believed him. When we first met Gary he seemed to be just as caring, just as thoughtful. He seemed to have such a happy disposition and enjoyed what he was doing. He went above and beyond to do his job and truly felt a part of the neighborhood.”

“All until last night, right?” Henry asked.

“Well, no. It was about a month since Gary started working our street did we begin to see unusual things happening around the neighborhood. It started with small things, like cars being detailed and tires slashed. We all put it all on neighborhood kids at first. 

Then the Anderson’s dog, Hobie went missing. Hobie was just a little shitzu, he never really roamed around the neighborhood. He was a very small dog. The entire neighborhood did everything they could to help find Hobie. But it was so sad because almost a month later, the little Anderson girl found the dog’s body stabbed in the throat. It was so sad,” Vizual began to tear up. 

“So you believe the mailman killed your neighbor’s dog and that is why you think he killed your husband?” Henry asked.

“No, I did not think Gary had anything to do with any of these things. It was only a few weeks later that I started to suspect Gary.

My husband had what many would call an anti-capitalist sentiment, I did not entirely agree with it, but that was his business. He often ordered socialist magazines and periodicals and had done so for years. It was only a few weeks ago that we started receiving death threats, calling my husband a socialist pig and commie bastard, things of that nature,” Vizual said.

“The biggest red flag was about three months ago, when my adopted mother passed away in Mexico. I received a letter from her attorney briefing me on the state of her affairs. Within a few days, I began to receive phone calls saying things like,

‘You’re mother was a whore. She’s burning in hell,’

You know it was really weird. My mother and I had several disagreements but I still appreciated her, those calls hurt. And what hurt the most was that they were so random, we had no idea who was making them, and the same went for the death threats as well. 

Remember, all of these things were happening at once. We couldn’t help to think that they were connected. Carlos and I came to the conclusion that the only way anyone could access any of this information was through the mail. We didn’t immediately assume it was Gary, but he was the only one who had access to our mail.”

“So why didn’t you go to the police?” Henry asked.

“Well, Carlos didn’t trust police, something involving a protest or something, I don’t remember. I agreed only because we didn’t really have anything on Gary, it was all assumptions. So we went to a private detective,” Vizual said.

“Yes, I heard the PI found that Gary was not the man’s real name. It was Solomon Tims, correct?” Henry said looking over his folder

Vizual nodded her head.

“Mr. Tims is a registered sex offender from New York and is currently a suspect for a murder in Rochester,” Henry said sifting through the report.

Vizual nodded again.

“So they PI tells you all this, what happened next? You didn’t go to the police?” Henry asked.

“Well, the detective said that he sent out a report to the police as soon as he ran his name on the database. He briefed us on everything after lunch and guess who we see strutting down the street ten minutes later. It was Gary, I mean Solomon. He had no idea what was happening. My husband went out and started screaming at him. I remember him yelling so clearly,

‘Get the fuck out of here! You think we didn’t know about you asshole, your gig is up, you’re finished’.

I watched him yell through the window. In retrospect, it probably would have been better to ignore him and let the police get to him. But my husband was angry and felt like he was a threat the whole neighborhood,” Vizual started to tear up again and she took another sip of coffee.

“Ok? So you just forget about Gary, I mean Solomon and go on with your lives?” Henry asked.

“I mean, what else are supposed to do. We thought the police could do their jobs and catch the guy. Yes, we went along with our regular business, we thought that was that and all our troubles were over, but obviously we were wrong,” Vizual said.

“I’m sure you’ve heard that police in Las Vegas have detained a postman by the name Gary LeFraine on vacation,” 

“Vacation my ass! His name is Solomon and he wasn’t relaxing, he was running. He is the one you need to be talking to.” Vizual said. 

“We will get what we need out of him, don’t worry. You say this Solomon guy, was wearing a mask when he broke in and killed your husband?”

“You’ve heard my story Agent Henry and frankly you’ve begun to get on my nerves. What exactly are you doing here and what does the D.E.A. want from me?” 

“Answer the question and I will answer yours,” 

“No, you answer my question, I am exhausted with this kind of berating. The only reason I keep having to repeat my story is so you can make sure what I am saying is straight,” 

Henry was irritated but he had enough composure to give in, he understood where she was coming from,

“It is about Carlos’ family, Vizual. I’m sure you are aware that Carlos’ father is a very wealthy man in Mexico. The D.E.A believes that his wealth did not come from exporting bananas. We believe that he is the central drug trafficker in all of Mexico. Now answer my question.” 

“He was wearing a mask, yes. A ski mask, the kind a common thief would wear. Carlos had cut ties with his family in Mexico…..”

Henry slid a picture of a man in a ski mask across the table to Vizual. Vizual was utterly shocked. She looked up with eyes full of fear.

“The man in this picture is named El Cucuy. From what we have gathered, he has risen to power in the crime world through acts of unspeakable violence. The mask is kind of a trademark. We believe that he has been working with Carlos’ father for many years, manhandling the southern part of the country for the Riveras syndicate.

Hernando has recently launched a political campaign and has begun to his cut ties with bosses who have a rather infamous reputation. When I say cut ties I mean sending a task force to murder anyone and everyone who lives in the same area of these bosses. I am of course referring to women, children and the bosses themselves. 

The DEA is of the suspicion that Cucuy has felt the pressure from Riveras in Mexico City and has gone on the offensive. We have tied him to several bombing and high profile murders of Riveras corporate employees,”

Henry slid more pictures to Vizual depicting men and women with decapitated heads. Vizual looked at them with a cold indifference.

“Listen Agent Henry, I understand the weight of this issue, but I am afraid it has nothing to do with Carlos or anyone in my family,”

“Do you think I’m an idiot, Vizual? I’ve been in DEA for almost fifteen years and this has turf war written all over it. I’ve given you a reason and you still believe it was your mailman? Wake up Vizual.  I hate to break it to you, but this has everything to do with this pretty little life you’ve made in America. If you don’t tell me what I need to know there will be more pictures like the ones I’ve shown you, more murders of innocent civilians,”

“I have told you everything. Carlos has not spoken with anyone in his family since he left for university and I definitely haven’t. His father was wealthy and Carlos hated him for his wealth. That is all I know. I do not blame Carlos, I believe he made the best decision for himself and for me. Hernando is the one who should pay, he is the one who should feel pain.”

“Do not fuck with me Vizual,” Henry slammed his fist on the desk. He gathered himself, calmly taking a deep breath and said,

“I know you loved him, I don’t doubt that. It is because of this love that you are not telling me the whole story, you must understand that the same love that you had for Carlos is what must bring you to open up to me, it must bring you to save millions of innocent lives,”

It was in this moment a deputy walked into the interrogation room,

“Mrs. Riveras?” He asked.

“What the fuck do you want?” Henry yelled.

“Mrs. Riveras’ time is up. The DA has informed us that if she is not a suspect we cannot detain her any longer.”

“Where the fuck are you going to go? Your house just burned down” Henry looked at Vizual.

“I have a friend that lives in Los Alamos. She said I could stay out her house for a few days,” 

Henry made his final statement just as she was walking out of the doorway.

“Vizual, I will get to the bottom of this, I promise you. Our eyes are on you. Ignorance does not play in this world, you are either the user or you are being used. It’s only a matter of time before someone else down South starts thinking the same things I am. It is an only a matter of time before you end up just like your husband, left alone in a burning house with a bullet in your head. I can promise you that,” Henry said lighting a cigarette.

Vizual showed actual anger in this moment. Her lips tightened up and her eyes watered. She looked like she was going to say something else, but all that came out was,

“Fucking cops,” She walked away shaking her head.

Even though his interrogation was cut short, Henry felt that he had succeeded. He saw nothing in Vizual’s eyes and he genuinely thought she didn’t know anything. He knew there was something else, and that something would come later. Vizual knew that he was on her tracks and that was really all he needed.

Henry was sorting through his files on Cucuy when he looked down at his watch, it read 6 o’clock, he was late.


Detective Sanchez walked into the Country General with a group of policemen. The group went straight to the burn unit, to the room of Greg Anderson. Greg was in a full body wrap with burns all over his body. He was in critical condition and all that was open to the world were his eyes, which he had shut closed with a wince. A slender middle-aged blonde woman sat in a chair adjacent to the bed.

“Hello Mrs. Anderson, how is he doing?”

The woman had eyes were bright red and she wiped dried tears off her face.

“The doctors said he going to be alright. Right now all they have to do is prevent any infection from invading his system,”

“That is good, very good,” Sanchez said.

“Has he shown any signs of waking up?”

“No, he has been sleeping for several hours, he needs his rest.”

“I know this can be a very emotional situation. Your husband is a very brave man, and you are a very strong woman. It is very important that we hear your side of the story. Were there any strange occurrences leading up to Mr. Riveras’ death?”

“No not at all, our neighborhood was very safe. We could not have seen this coming at all. Carlos was such a nice guy and the neighborhood is worse off without him,” Mrs. Anderson said.

“His wife is pretty convinced that your mailman, Gary LeFraine, committed this crime. Had you witness anything weird going on with him?”

“Gary, no, not at all,” 

“You said Carlos’ wife thought this?”

The heart monitor made a sharp beep of activity. Mrs. Anderson and Sanchez looked over for a brief moment to see Greg in the same position as they had left him. They returned to their conversation,

“Carlos was a single man. He had a few girlfriends, but we never knew about a wife,”

The once quiet room was filled with the sounds of monitors going off. Greg had woken up and was struggling to say something.

“We need a doctor in here hurry!”


Henry walked through the door to his apartment in a rush. He threw his keys on the counter and began to take his jacket off. His girlfriend was curled up watching Ellen reruns,

“Where the hell have you been, I’ve been waiting?” She said.

“I’m sorry babe, there was a huge accident on 25. Where the fuck is Kenda?” He said without missing a beat.

Henry had promised to watch the Homicide Hunter marathon with his girlfriend that night and had thought he had missed it.

“Don’t worry, I’ve been recording it. Whenever you’re ready we can get it going,”

“Thanks babe, you’re the best,” Henry kissed her on the forehead and went to pop some popcorn and grab some beers.

Henry, very methodically, handed one beer to his girlfriend and placed the bowl of popcorn in a nook of the couch where the bowl would not spill over. He loosened his tie and his girlfriend rested her head on his chest. They both cracked open their beers and fired up the recording. 

Joe Kenda, the host of Homicide Hunter, was a no-nonsense ex-detective who had seen every kind of crime in the Colorado Springs area. He retold his old sagas of justice while the younger Kenda reenacted the stories on screen.

One day, he would have what Kenda had, Henry thought to himself. He would be there, in charge of his whole department, calling the shots.

 Kenda’s mid-western twang sounded through the TV, just his voice got Henry excited. 

“What happened in this small Colorado suburb, no one knew. A local professor was left shot in the head as his home burned down around him. No one could imagine who would commit such a terrible crime in a neighborhood as safe as this one. It turns out the suspect might be closer to home than anyone would think,” Joe Kenda said.

Henry stuffed a handful of popcorn into his mouth.

“You know, the case I followed up on today, was just like this.” Henry mentioned to his girlfriend with a mouthful of popcorn.

“Really?”

“Oh yeah, pretty terrible stuff, he was even a professor too,”

Henry whipped his attention back to Kenda like a child watching Saturday morning cartoons.

“We pulled up to the scene of the burned house. We found out that the entire building had burned down and one man was found dead with a bullet wound in his head. Two witnesses were found, one being the murdered man’s wife,” The scene’s moved from old Kenda, to the younger, more handsome version observing the crime scene.

“When we interrogated the wife, she was obviously in a bad place. She was convinced it was the local postman who conducted this murder,” Kenda announced.

With a mouthful of food, Henry chuckled sharply,

“This is exactly like the case I was working today, exactly like it.” 

As soon as Henry said this, his quick nonchalant chewing turned into a slow churn, something clicked inside of his head.

He leaned forward on the couch and his girlfriend slid off his chest.

“Honey, what’s wrong?”

He could not hear her. His mind drifted back to the interrogation room with Vizual. All he could think about was Vizual’s response playing back in his head when he asked what she was watching the night of the murder,

“Homicide Hunter,”

“Homicide Hunter,” Her voice rang in his head, over and over.

He grabbed the remote and fast forwarded through the episode. New mailman, weird phone calls, death threats, dead dog; it was all there.

He was now glued to the T.V. screen.

“When we ran his name in the database, you’ll never guess what we found,” Kenda said.

The episode cut to commercial.

“Bastards!” Henry screamed. At this point, his girlfriend was yelling at him. He couldn’t think about anything else.

He fast-forwarded through commercials about hearing aids and adult diapers.

“It turned out this mailman was not telling the truth. He had been making deliveries on the east coast too, previously being convicted of child molestation. He was the leading suspect of a murder case in Rochester, New York when he skipped town.”

Time had moved in slow motion, and the sounds of the room drifted into the background. He thought back to the interrogation room, he looked at Kenda, he could no longer hear the TV. He looked at his girlfriend who continued to scream at him, he looked up at God to see if what he thought was possible was even possible at all. Then, out of the buzz of white noise, his phone rang.

“Huh” Henry uttered in a numbed frustration.

“Hey Henry, this is Sanchez. Listen, I don’t have a lot of time. I was just in the hospital visiting Greg Anderson. Greg’s wife told me that Carlos had never been married. She had never heard of a Vizual Riveras,”  

Henry was frozen.

“And get this, Anderson woke up and told us that he had seen the masked killer, he had seen Cucuy! I’m sending you the sketch based on the description he gave us,”

Henry very slowly hung up the phone and looked at the picture Sanchez had sent him. His hands trembled as he tried to pull up the image. He opened the message. It was a sketch of a woman with grey hair and glasses.
